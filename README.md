# VSCode Theme Parser

## AI statement

**This project was generated by Claude 3.7, and only afterward modified by hand.**

I firmly believe that where AI is used to write significant amounts of code, it should be made very clear up front.

In this case, I just wanted the details of a theme file, I couldn't be bothered writing a whole utility to get them.

The respository is shared in case it's useful to anyone else; I do not want, nor do I claim, credit for the work.

## About

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES ⚠️

> This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh). It is important that you use it too.
>
> `bun` is both a package manager and a runtime, capable of running TypeScript files directly without a separate compilation step. This package does not include TypeScript compilation, which would cause it to fail on other package managers and runtimes.
>
> Make sure you have Bun installed before working with this project:
>
> ```bash
> # Install Bun (macOS, Linux, or WSL)
> curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
> ```
>
> To execute this software, use `bun start` followed by the command-line options and arguments you need.

## Report Features

The generated HTML report includes:

- **Hierarchical Tree View**: Color properties are organized by category (editor, terminal, etc.)
- **Color Swatches**: Visual representation of all UI and token colors
- **Manual Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark mode with one click
- **Expanded Categories**: All color categories are expanded by default for easy browsing
