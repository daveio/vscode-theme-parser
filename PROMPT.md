# Prompt

> Write some software to read the metadata and colours from a Visual Studio Code theme file and summarise them in an HTML document. Quit out if the user does not specify both an input file and an output file, explaining the syntax of the command. Use a proper CLI argument parser to allow it to be invoked by the package manager or directly. Include colour swatches of the relevant colours. Pretty up the HTML. You are allowed to import CSS and JavaScript from the Web, perhaps from unpkg but you have the choice. Handle parsing a `.vsix` file as the input. Include information about the other content of the `.vsix` file. If you are going to use JavaScript, use TypeScript instead. Use the current directory as the project directory. Include extensive comments. Create a `NOTES.md` file with extensive documentation about how the program works. Use the `bun` package manager if you use TypeScript or JavaScript. Make the CLI colourful and attractive, with animations and progress spinners. Categorise the colours in a visual tree structure in the output HTML. Expand all the tree branches by default. Make the text of the branch names monospace. Give it a switchable light or dark theme, defaulting to dark.
